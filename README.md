# Shopping Cart

This is a shopping cart I built using React.js while familiarising myself with the Context API and useReducer hook. 

Users can use a text input to search for a product, as well as a number of different filters to sort through products, the data for which I took from Faker.

They can then add them to (and delete them from) a cart, which calculates a subtotal for you.

Clicking 'proceed to checkout' doesn't take you anywhere as I am of course not really selling anything!
