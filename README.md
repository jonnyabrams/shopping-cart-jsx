# Shopping Cart

Try it out: [https://shopping-cart-jsx.vercel.app/](https://shopping-cart-jsx.vercel.app/)

This is a shopping cart I built using React.js while familiarising myself with Context API state management and the useReducer hook. 

Users can use a text input to search through products, the data for which I took from Faker, as well as a number of different filters such as ascending/descending price, availability and ratings.

They can then add them to (and delete them from) a cart, which calculates a subtotal for you.

Clicking 'proceed to checkout' doesn't take you anywhere as I am of course not really selling anything!
